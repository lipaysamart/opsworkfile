# The check is implemented using a Kubernetes Job- if you are injecting mesh
# sidecar proxies into cert-manager pods, you probably want to ensure that they
# are not injected into this Job's pod. Otherwise the installation may time out
# due to the Job never being completed because the sidecar proxy does not exit.
